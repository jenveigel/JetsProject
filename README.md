Grading

This is a graded project. You are expected to have your project completed by the start of class on Monday morning.

You will be given either a pass or fail based on whether your code works given all of the following test conditions:

When menu option 1 is pressed all Jets in the fleet are displayed to the user.
When menu option 2 is selected, the fastest jet from the list of Jets should be displayed to the user.
When menu option 3 is selected, the jet with the longest range should be displayed to the user.
When option 4 is pressed you should be prompted to enter the model, speed (in MPH), range, and price. This Jet should be added to the list of Jets so that when the user again selects menu option 1, that custom jet is included.
Option 5 should exit the program.
